        <h1>The Struggle To Get Borough Park Vaccinated</h1>
        <p>By Amanda Rozon</p>
        <p>Nov 11, 2021</p>

    <div class="container">
        <p>Despite efforts from leading voices in the Rabbinical community and the city to get Borough Park Orthodox Jews protected against COVID-19, the neighborhood remains largely unvaccinated and transmission is high.</p>
        
        <p>Around 48% of people in Borough Park have at least one vaccine dose, well below the city's overall average of 73%, according to COVID-19 data provided by <a href= "https://www1.nyc.gov/site/doh/covid/covid-19-data-neighborhoods.page">the Health Department.</a>  But low vaccination rates aren’t only affecting local positive cases.  At least one restaurant in the predominantly Orthodox Jewish neighborhood is feeling the effects of the city’s two-month-old vaccine mandate for indoor dining in New York City’s lowest vaccinated neighborhood.</p>

                <p>Data shows the percentage of people vaccinated with at least one dose</p>
            </div>
        <div class="container" >
        <p>This is now the third week in a row that Borough Park has received the highest positive case status.  And with the fear of a winter surge just around the corner, the rush to get more Borough Parkers vaccinated is dire.  </p>
